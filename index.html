            <li>My name is Noah Gottlieb and i was born in <em>Savannah, GA</em> in <strong>1987</strong> but moved to <em>Portland, OR</em> in <strong>1997</strong> and have been living here since.</li>
            <li>I have been programming off and as far back as i can remember. In my elementary school i learned basic programming on a Commodore 64.</li>
            <li>I love problem and the resulting gratification it provides when the problem is fixed.</li>
            <li>I have many hobbies that include:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Hikiing</li>
                <li>Playing Guitar, Ukele, and Electric Bass</li>
                <li>Snowboarding</li>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Boardgames <em>(Catan!)</em></li>
              </ol>
            <li>I chose to attend Epicodus after doing months of research and seeking out past programming bootcamp students to find the best fit for me. Epicodus became a clear choice with their connections to the local tech community and how they were percieved within the industry.</li>
